# The Synapse Learning Suite
**Project Objective**: Transcend the standard limitations of Pine Script by implementing advanced machine learning and evolutionary algorithms.

## Module 1: Bayesian Trust Network (Self-Healing Ensemble)
- **Concept**: A real-time efficacy monitoring engine for Meta-Learner slots.
- **Mechanism**: Calculates a rolling "Trust Multiplier" for indicator inputs based on their recent signal-to-outcome profitability.
- **Hack**: Overcomes "Market Regime Blindness" by automatically de-weighting indicators that lose their edge during transitions.

## Module 2: The Neural Synapse (Perceptron Emulator)
- **Concept**: Non-linear feature integration using actual Synapse Mathematics (`Synapse.mult`).
- **Mechanism**: A forward-propagation engine that evaluates 3+ indicators as neurons, applying weights and activation functions to find the "Global Consensus."
- **Hack**: Escapes the "If/Else" trap of standard strategy stacking, allowing indicators to interact non-linearly (e.g., Slot A amplifies Slot C only when Slot B is neutral).

## Module 3: Harmonic Fractal Resonance (Multiresolution Memory)
- **Concept**: Lorentzian ML memory that spans across multiple timefractions.
- **Mechanism**: Feature vectors are "packed" with data from both the current execution timeframe (15s) and higher context timeframes (1m/5m).
- **Hack**: Solves the "Indeterminate State" problem by ensuring that a bullish pattern must look "Harmonic" across both fast and slow fractals to qualify as a signal.

## Module 4: Structural Vitality (Exhaustion & Absorption)
- **Concept**: identifying "Hidden Exhaustion" where volume and price move in high-conviction divergence.
- **Mechanism**: Calculates Cumulative Delta Divergence and Volume Decay at 5s resolution using lower timeframe (`1S`) clusters.
- **Hack**: Replaces lagging retail indicators with raw institutional vitality metrics, ensuring the Hub only enters when the "heartbeat" of the market is strong.

## Module 5: The Tape (Tape-Speed Execution)
- **Concept**: Direct integration of raw footprint volume into the neural consensus.
- **Mechanism**: Analyzes Delta momentum and Absorption (high volume/low move) to gate signal quality.
- **Hack**: Prioritizes "Real Money" flow over indicator math, ensuring entries only occur during high-efficiency volume surges.

## Module 6: The Oracle (Forward-Propagation Engine)
- **Concept**: Transforming the system from a reactive logic to a predictive one.
- **Mechanism**: Uses PMO (Predictive Momentum Oscillator) to forecast velocity and price projections for the next 3-5 bars.
- **Hack**: Anticipates trend exhaustion and expansion phases before they confirm on lagging indicators.

## Module 7: Multiresolution Momentum (Categorical Slot E)
- **Concept**: Cross-frame oscillator consensus that filters out "noisy" LTF signals.
- **Mechanism**: Aggregates 1m, 5m, and 15m momentum oscillators into a single categorical bus output.
- **Hack**: Ensures that the 5s execution layer never trades against the "Structural Wave" of higher timeframes, providing a high-confluence anchor for the neural Synapse.

## Module 8: Forensic Structure (Order & Chaos)
- **Concept**: The feedback loop between predicted structure (Order) and statistical deviation (Chaos).
- **Mechanism**: Uses a **Silent Auditor** to measure the physical limits of price extension (clusters of MFE/MAE) and a **Rational Quadratic Kernel** to define the trend baseline.
- **Hack**: Replaces "Guesswork Targets" with data-driven **Forensic Limits**. The Execution Engine dynamically adjusts its greed (Target) and fear (Stop) based on whether the trade is complying with Order (Pro-Trend) or devolving into Chaos (Counter-Trend).
