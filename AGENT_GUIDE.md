# 🧠 Synapse Learning Suite: Agent Operational Guide

**Version**: 1.0 (QuantVue Epoch)
**Standard**: Axon-Link v3.0 / Bayesian Neural Consensus
**Developer Reference**: Selfsimilarity

## 1. System Philosophy
The Synapse is a **Multi-Agent Consensus System**. It treats individual indicators as "voters" with dynamic weightage based on their recent win-rate (Efficacy). It moves away from static "if/else" logic into a probabilistic execution model.

### The Three Layers:
1.  **Layer 1 (Perception)**: Sub-Hubs (Order Flow, QuantVue, ML) analyze raw data.
2.  **Layer 2 (Cognition)**: Master Hub (Centrifuge) performs weighted voting and Bayesian auditing.
3.  **Layer 3 (Protective)**: Fatigue Guard / Synapse Execution Bus handles risk management and trailing logic.

## 2. The Axon-Link Pulse Protocol
All communication occurs via price-encoded "Neural Wires" to prevent repainting and enable 0ms latency between scripts.

- **Wire 200 (Intelligence)**: Relays categorical data from Sub-Hub to Master.
- **Wire 100 (Execution)**: Relays final trade commands from Master to Bridge.

## 3. Case Study: QuantVue Expansion (2026-02-09)
### The Problem:
Integrating 10 disjointed QuantVue tools (Moneyball, Qcloud, etc.) into a cohesive trade signal without UI clutter.

### The Solution:
- **Architecture**: Created a "Composite Sub-Hub" (`Synapse_SubHub_QuantVue`).
- **Logic**: Replicated 10 nodes into a single confluence arithmetic.
- **Result**: The 10 tools now occupy only **one slot** (Slot E) on the Master Hub, leaving 7 slots open for other institutional data.
- **Aesthetic**: Implemented "Glass Bridge" UI standard (Emerald/Crimson on Semi-Trans Black).

## 4. How to Expand the Suite
When asked to "Add institutional feature X":
1.  **Check Slots**: Is there an open slot (A-H)?
2.  **Check Library**: Use `Synapse.f_Synapse_dbw` from `Selfsimilarity/selfsimilarty` for any new learnable logic.
3.  **Visuals**: Follow the `Synapse x QuantVue` table standard for the HUD.
4.  **Audit**: Ensure the new logic can be "audited" by the Master Hub (it must provide a clear Bias -1/0/1).

---

## 5. Maintenance Checklist
- **Win-Rate Drift**: If a Sub-Hub’s win-rate stays below 45% for 10 trades, its output is naturally dampened by the Master Hub.
- **Library Updates**: All core math must reside in `Selfsimilarity/selfsimilarty` to prevent cross-script version mismatch.
